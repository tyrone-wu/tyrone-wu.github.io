          I'm not a competitive programmer, but I decided to go competitive mode
          this year since I was curious to see where I would place against everybody
          else. Unfortunately, LLM army also decided to raid the rankings as well.

          I was so convinced that my input was bugged for Day 6 part 2. Turns out,
          it was my reading comprehension that was bugged. ðŸ« 
          <br />
          For times that went over 12 hrs, I wasn't able to solve it on my own and
          ended up getting hints from the subreddit to solve it.
          <br />
          All things considered, I think I did decent. at least I hope so? I don't
          have a reference to go off of, and AoC attracts a ton of cracked ppl.
