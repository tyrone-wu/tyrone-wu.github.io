      <h4 class="font-bold underline mb-0">2024 Times & Ranks</h4>

      I'm not a competitive programmer, but I decided to actually try on release
      this year since I was curious to see where I would place against everybody
      else. Unfortunately, LLM army also decided to raid the rankings as well.
      ðŸ˜•

      <Image
        class="!my-2 size-fit"
        src={aocTimes}
        alt="aoc-2024-times"
        width={601}
        height={637}
      />

      I was so convinced that my input was bugged for Day 6 part 2. Turns out,
      it was my reading comprehension that was bugged. ðŸ« 
      <br />
      For times that went over 12 hrs, I ended up getting hints from the subreddit
      to complete it.
      <br />
      All things considered, I think I did decent. at least I hope so? I don't have
      a reference to go off of, and AoC attracts a ton of cracked ppl.
