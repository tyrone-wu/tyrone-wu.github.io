# Final Thoughts

I am faaaar from an expert on these sort of things, I'm just doing this for fun and bc I'm
interested.
There's a lot of experts and docs online that I constantly refer to make this work which I'll link
here.

Right now, I'm only using my services locally from my main PC, so this network and storage setup is
fine for now (although will definitely change once I get my own place and expand my homelab).

## Hyper-V vs Proxmox

Hyper-V and Proxmox both work for my needs.
I'm not running any usecases that require some optimal setup.

But here's what I like about each:

- #### What I like about Hyper-V

  Hyper-V Manager GUI is cleaner and is more intuitive to use -- especially if you're completely
  new since it just "works" right of the box.

  Simple things like setting up a virtual switch, checkpoints (snapshot equivalent for Proxmox),
  manual backups, and recovery are very straightforward.

- #### What I like about Proxmox

  Spinning up ephemeral VMs (at least from what tested) feels much faster on Proxmox compared to
  Hyper-V.

  LXC containers are extremely convenient for hosting single-purpose services.

  There's a much larger community with more resources/guides/docs online (like
  [PVE Helper Scripts](https://community-scripts.github.io/ProxmoxVE)) than Hyper-V.
  I've found that there wasn't much guides or blogs online for Hyper-V. Most of their support
  appears to come from being enterprise customers.

Final note from what I've researched, a big feature of Proxmox is `ZFS`, which I'm currently not
using.
I'm not concerned over data integrity so `ext4` is acceptable (maybe for now).

## Future Todos

- automate entire setup with Terraform and/or Ansible.
  all the configuration of the PVE environment and services were done manually.
  would make migration to a better setup so much easier.

- ~make my own dashboard~ customize my homepage.
  a current battery power status for laptop to homepage

- move jellyfin to hyper-v.

- maybe move influx and grafana to hyper-v too?
