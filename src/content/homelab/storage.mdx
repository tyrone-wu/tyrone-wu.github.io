# Storage

My laptop only has a single SSD formatted with `ext4`, and I disabled HA/auto-backups so it doesn't
wear out the disk too fast.
All my media is instead manually backed up on my main PC.

On PVE host, I store media for [Kavita](https://github.com/Kareadita/Kavita) and
[Jellyfin](https://github.com/jellyfin/jellyfin) under `/mnt/media`.
The LXCs access these files through [bind mount points](https://pve.proxmox.com/wiki/Linux_Container#_bind_mount_points).

However, since the containers are *unprivileged*, they currently can't write those directories
(which plan to improve in the future).
For now, I transfer files from my main PC via `scp`.

I've considered using [TrueNAS](https://github.com/truenas) with a mounted flash drive to manage my
media storage, however, that drive is what I use to install Proxmox and is the only one I have. :/
