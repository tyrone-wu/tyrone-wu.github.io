My PC is a whole lot beefier than my laptop, so most of my services are hosted on Hyper-V.

Even though I have DockerDesktop app on my Windows root host, I do all container related stuff in
the Debian VM on Hyper-V.

All my previous lab documentation is logged in [/homelab/deprecated](/homelab/deprecated).
