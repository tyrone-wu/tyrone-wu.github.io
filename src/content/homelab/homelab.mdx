# My Homelab

This is my homecooked homelab. :)

I initially started with WSL2, and later migrated to Hyper-V on my main PC workstation.

Then I installed Proxmox VE on a Lenovo Thinkpad (that my sister got for free from her previous
workplace) since I wanted to try out Proxmox for fun and also offload some stuff off my PC.

I use my homelab for dev work, storing/reading eBooks, host & preserve üè≥Ô∏è‚Äçüåà chinese TV shows (some
unfortunately banned in China :c), learn networking, and test scripts in sandbox/ephemeral
environments.

There's a lot I like to document, so I'll try to keep things short.
