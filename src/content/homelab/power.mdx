# Power

My laptop doesn't stay plugged in 24/7 to protect battery health. I typically charge it when
battery is low or when it's powered off.

Since I'm not running any services that require 100% uptime, so I shutdown the it down like I do
with my main PC.

I've also configured the laptop to turn off screen after a few sec of inactivity, and also continue
running when lid is closed. [guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_u8qTN3cCnQ&t=1588s)
