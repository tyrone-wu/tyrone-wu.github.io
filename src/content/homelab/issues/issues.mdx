# Issues Encountered

This section is a vomit of documented issues & fixes that I've encountered while homelabbing that's
formatted to be somewhat readable (at least for me :P).

Not sure if this would be interesting to read form your POV since it's mostly just me struggling,
but this is mainly for me to look back on.

Note: I've only taken an intro networking course about the OSI model -- nothing practical.
So a lot of this might sound dumb or obvious to yall reading this, but this entire debugging &
troubleshooting process was a good learning moment for me. xd
