<!-- # Installing Proxmox VE on Hyper-V -->

Here are instructions for installing Proxmox on Hyper-V. If you don't have a homelab setup and want to play with proxmox, then this _should_ be good enough sandbox environment for you. ðŸ™ƒ

You will definitely encounter some quirks. I originally wrote this a while back, so I don't quite recall what additional configurations I used to get this working (or at least not broken :P).

## Prerequisite

- Have Windows [nested virtualization](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/virtualization/hyper-v-on-windows/user-guide/enable-nested-virtualization) feature (I had to upgrade to Windows 11 for this).
- Enable [virtualization](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/enable-virtualization-on-windows-11-pcs-c5578302-6e43-4b4b-a449-8ced115f58e1).

## Install Steps

1. Download the [Proxmox VE ISO](https://www.proxmox.com/en/downloads).

2. Open Hyper-V Manager, and select `New` > `Virtual Machine` on the right panel.

3. Configure the VM as you like (name, memory, storage, etc.), but make sure that `Generation 1` is selected.

For the network configuration, I chose `Default Switch`.

Under `Connect Virtual Hard Disk` > `Installation Options`, select `Install an operating system from a bootable CD/DVD-ROM` > `Image file (.iso)` and choose the ISO that you downloaded from part 1.

Finally, select `Finish` to create the VM.

4. Next is enabling nested virtualization on the VM. Open Powershell with Admin privileges, and execute:

```bash
Set-VMProcessor -VMName $VmName -ExposeVirtualizationExtensions $true
```

If you do not enable nested virtualization, you will be met with this pop-up when starting the VM.

5. To start/boot the VM, select it under the `Virtual Machines` tab in Hyper-V Manager, then select `Connect` > `Start`.

6. Select `Install Proxmox VE (Graphical)`, and it should now take you through the installation setup. Note, you can only use the `arrow keys` for navigation, `enter` to select, and `esc` to go back.

7. Finally on the Summary window, uncheck `Automatically reboot after successful installation` (since we need to remove the ISO before we reboot), and select `Install`.

8. After it finishes installing, it should display `Installation successful!` along with `Next steps`. Instead of immediately rebooting, we must first remove the ISO or else rebooting will take us back to the installation setup again.

To do this, first `Shut Down` (or `Turn Off`) the VM in Hyper-V Manager.

![step8](../../assets/blog/proxmox-on-hyperv/step8.png)

Open `Settings` for the VM on the lower right panel. Then select the `DVD Drive` that contains the proxmox ISO, and `Remove`.

![step9](../../assets/blog/proxmox-on-hyperv/step9.png)

Select `Apply` > `Okay` to finish.

9. Now start the VM, and you should be shown this window. Open the outputted URL (i covered in pink) in your preferred web browser.

![step10_part1](../../assets/blog/proxmox-on-hyperv/step10-1.png)

Enter your login credentials that you configured from part 6. The `User name` is defaulted to `root`.

Congrats, you now have Proxmox installed on Hyper-V and the web dashboard up and running!!! á•™(^â–¿^-á•™)

IIRC, you'll need to enable [MAC address spoofing](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/answers/questions/1075755/enable-mac-address-spoofing) in order for your containers to correctly receive traffic from public (but i might be wrong since it's been a while).
