I’m Tyrone Wu (yes that is my real birthname 🫠), and I’m a systems programmer who specializes in the infrastructure, networking, and operational sides of software.

I graduated from NC State University 🐺 with a B.S. + Master's of Computer Science, along with a Statistics Minor, through the Accelerated Bachelor's/Master's Program.

I enjoy weightlifting, watching spooky/goofy stuff, and contributing to open-source projects related to eBPF 🐝. I recently just got back, and am in the process of building my very first homelab!
